# Technical Architecture Documentation
## RESPA Compliance System Design

### System Overview

The Circle Platform implements a comprehensive RESPA compliance system with automated controls, risk assessment, and audit capabilities designed to prevent prohibited kickbacks and referral fees under RESPA Section 8.

### Database Architecture

#### Core Compliance Tables

**`co_pay_requests`** - Primary transaction records
- Unique identifier and participant tracking
- Split percentage and service details
- Multi-stage status progression
- Immutable audit timestamps

**`compliance_workflow_log`** - Complete audit trail
- Every action and status change recorded
- User identification and timestamps
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Document attachment references

**`compliance_documents`** - Evidence collection
- Required documentation by service type
- File integrity verification
- Approval status tracking
- Retention period management

**`agreement_signatures`** - Legal agreement management
- Dual-party e-signature capture
- Digital signature verification
- Agreement template versioning
- Legal enforceability metadata

### Security Framework

#### Data Integrity
- **Immutable Records**: Core compliance data cannot be deleted
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Document integrity verification
- **Audit Timestamps**: All changes tracked with precise timing
- **Role-Based Access**: Segregation of duties enforcement

#### Access Controls
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all compliance actions
- **Permission Matrix**: Granular access control by user role
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeouts
- **IP Tracking**: Geographic and network-based monitoring

### Workflow Engine

#### Automated State Transitions
```
Pending Vendor → Vendor Approved → Pending Compliance → 
Compliance Approved → Final Approved
```

#### Validation Rules
- **Service Risk Assessment**: Automated categorization
- **Split Percentage Limits**: Fair market value enforcement
- **Documentation Requirements**: Service-specific evidence collection
- **Approval Authority**: Role-based approval routing

### Integration Points

#### External Systems
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for transaction handling
