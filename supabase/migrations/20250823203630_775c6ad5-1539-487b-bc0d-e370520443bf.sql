-- SECURITY FIX: Protect real estate agent personal information
-- Create granular access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

-- Remove the overly permissive business partners policy first

-- Drop old policies that will be replaced
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own agent profile" ON public.agents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own agent profile" ON public.agents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own agent profile" ON public.agents;

-- Drop existing views to avoid conflicts
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS agents_business_contact CASCADE;

-- Policy 3: Agents can create their own profile
